Audio: built in sounds **V2** 
================================

Expressive sounds  **V2** 
--------------------------

| The built-in expressive sounds can be called using ``audio.play(Sound.SOUNDNAME)`` where SOUNDNAME is replaced with the name of a sound in capital letters.
| e.g. ``audio.play(Sound.GIGGLE)``

The built in sounds are

* Sound.GIGGLE
* Sound.HAPPY
* Sound.HELLO
* Sound.MYSTERIOUS
* Sound.SAD
* Sound.SLIDE
* Sound.SOARING
* Sound.SPRING
* Sound.TWINKLE
* Sound.YAWN


.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import audio

    audio.play(Sound.GIGGLE)


| The code below uses a for-loop to loop through each sound in the ``sound_list`` and play each sound.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import audio

    sound_list = [Sound.GIGGLE, Sound.TWINKLE]
    for sound in sound_list:
        audio.play(sound)

.. admonition:: Tasks

    #. Play the HELLO sound and scroll "hello" using wait=False for the sound and wait=True for the text.

                        display.scroll("hello", wait=True)
                        sleep(1000)

            .. tab-item:: Q2

                Play the HELLO sound and scroll "hello" using wait=False for the sound and wait=True for the text.
                
                .. code-block:: python

                    while True:
                        audio.play(Sound.HELLO, wait=False)
                        display.scroll("hello", wait=True)

All Built in sounds
----------------------------------------

| The code below plays all the built-in sounds.
| the A-button can be pressed to exit the for-loop then the while-loop using ``break``.
| Pressing the reset button on the back of the microbit will restart the code.

        Sound.GIGGLE,

Sound name with sound
--------------------------

| The advanced code below uses ``replace`` methods on the string version of the sound to get the simple name of the sound for scrolling.
| The sound playing is started first, using the non-blocking form with ``wait=False``.
| The sound name is scrolled using the blocking form with ``wait=True``, so that the the next sound is not played till the scrolling has completed.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import audio

    sound_list = [Sound.GIGGLE, Sound.TWINKLE]
    for sound in sound_list:
        # Remove 'Sound(' from the start and ')' from the end
        sound_name = str(sound).replace("Sound('", '').replace("')", '')
        audio.play(sound, wait=False)
        display.scroll(sound_name, delay=80, wait=True)

Built in sounds and images
---------------------------

| The following code uses a dictionary to associate sounds and images.
| It then displays the image and plays the sound.
| In the code ``for emotion, attributes in emotions.items():``, 'emotion, attributes' follow the pattern 'key, value', where emotion is the key and attribute is the value for that key.
| 'happy' is the first emotion (key). Its value, attribute, is a nested dictionary with keys 'sound' and 'image'.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import audio

    # Define the sounds and images for happy and sad emotions
    emotions = {
        'happy': {
            'sound': Sound.HAPPY,
            'image': Image.HAPPY
        },
        'sad': {
            'sound': Sound.SAD,
            'image': Image.SAD
        }
    }

    while True:
        for emotion, attributes in emotions.items():
            # Display the image
            display.show(attributes['image'])
            # Play the sound
            audio.play(attributes['sound'], wait=True)
            display.clear()
            sleep(1000)
