while True loops

| While loops run a set of statements as long as a test condition is true.

| ``while True:`` loops run forever.
| Instead of using a condition that returns True or False, ``True`` is used in place of the condition to make the condition always True. As a result, the while loop runs forever.

| The statements within the loop are indented with the tab key (which is equivalent to 4 spaces) to make those lines part of the while loop.

| The ``while True`` loop below scrolls the text ``I never stop`` across the LED display, over and over again.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *

    while True:
        display.scroll('I never stop')


When testing code on the microbit, it can be useful to do it within a ``while True`` loop so the results can be seen over and over again.
