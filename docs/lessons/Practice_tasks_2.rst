    3.  Write code in a ``while True`` loop to respond to button pressing such that when A is pressed each character in 'go team' is scrolled quickly using a **for-loop**, when B is pressed each sport in the **list** ``['swimming', 'rowing', 'canoeing']`` is scrolled quickly using a **for-loop**, and when no button is pressed the screen is **cleared**.
    4.  Write code in a ``while True`` loop to respond to button pressing such that when A is pressed the numbers 0, 1, 2 are scrolled quickly using the range function, when B is pressed the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are scrolled quickly using the range function, and when no button is pressed the screen is cleared.
