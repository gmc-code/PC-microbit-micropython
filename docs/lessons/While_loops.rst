While loops
====================================================

| See: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp
| While loops run a set of statements as long as a test condition is true.
| The statements within the loop are indented.

Events as conditions
----------------------------------------

| While loops have a condition that is tested each time the loop runs.
| The condition must be True for the loop to run.
| If the condition is False, the loop is exited.

| Button pressing can be used as the condition in a while loop.
| In the code below, the code within the while loop runs only while the A button is being held down.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *

    while True:
        while button_a.is_pressed():
            display.show(['I', Image.HEART, 'U'], delay=400)
            sleep(300)
        display.show(Image.ALL_CLOCKS, delay=50)

                Write a while loop that displays a sad face while the B button is pressed, and when it is not, Image.ALL_CLOCKS is used to display a rotating clock hand.

                            sleep(300)
                        display.show(Image.ALL_CLOCKS, delay=50)

Counters
----------------------------------------

| While loops have a condition that is tested each time the loop runs.
| The condition must be True for the loop to run.
| If the condition is False, the loop is exited.

| A counter can be used in the while loop condition.
| The counter is set before the while loop.
| The counter is incremented (increased by a constant amount) in a while loop. 

----

Counting up
----------------------------------------

.. image:: images/while_counter.png
    :scale: 75 %
    :align: center

| In the example below, ``i`` is the counter.
| ``i`` starts off at 0 and is increased by 1 in the while loop line: ``i += 1``.
| ``i += 1`` is the same as ``i = i + 1``
| While the condition, ``i < 10``, is True the while loop runs.
| ``i += 1`` causes ``i`` to increase from 0 to 9.
| The while loop exits when ``i`` is 10 since ``i < 10`` will be False when ``i = 10``.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *

    while True:
        i = 0
        while i < 10:
            display.scroll(i, delay=50)
            i += 1

----

Counting down
----------------------------------------

| In the code below, ``i`` starts off at 5 and is decreased by 1 in the while loop line: ``i -= 1``.
| ``i -+= 1`` is the same as ``i = i - 1``
| The test uses a ``>`` sign when counting down.
| The loop below stops when ``i`` is no longer greater than 1, i.e. when it is 1.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *

    while True:
        i = 5
        while i > 1:
            display.scroll(i, delay=50)
            i -= 1

----

Step size
----------------------------------------

| The code below counts up from 0 to 10 in steps of 2. 
| ``i += 2`` sets a step size of 2.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *

    while True:
        i = 0
        while i < 11:
            display.scroll(i, delay=50)
            i += 2
