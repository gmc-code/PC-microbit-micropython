Types of Errors
====================================================

| Working out what has gone wrong and how to fix it is a key part of everyday programming.
| Some errors will show up using the **check** button.


| Some errors will not show up using the **check** button, but instead, will be scrolled on the microbit as an error message when the microbit is flashed. 
| They contain the **line** number for where you should start to identify and fix the issue.

Checking for errors
---------------------------------------------

| Press the **check** button in Mu editor to view syntax errors and other errors.
| If the code is flashed to the microbit without first checking it, the microbit will give the line number with an error.
