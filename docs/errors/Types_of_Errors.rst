Types of Errors
====================================================

| Working out what has gone wrong and how to fix it is a key part of everyday programming.

| This section refers to errors using the online editor at: https://python.microbit.org/v/3

| Most errors will be indicated by a red dot in the left margin and by red underlines or a small red triangle.

| If an error is not immediately detected, the microbit will scroll an error message when the microbit is flashed. 
| The error message will contain the **line** number for where you should start to identify and fix the issue.
