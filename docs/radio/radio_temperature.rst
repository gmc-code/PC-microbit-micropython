Radio temperature
====================================================

Indoor and outdoor temperature
------------------------------

| Set up the group in pairs with a value 0-255 by modifying the group in: ``radio.config(group=8)``.
| Turn on the radio using: ``radio.on()``
| Use different code for the outdoor microbit compared to the indoor.

| Outdoor: Set up the outdoor microbit so that it only sends the temperature every minute  

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import radio

    # Choose own group in pairs 0-255
    radio.config(group=8)
    # Turn on the radio
    radio.on()

    while True:
        outdoor_temp = temperature()
        radio.send(str(outdoor_temp))
        sleep(60000)

| Indoor: Set up the indoor microbit so that pressing the A-button displays the indoor temperature and pressing the B-button displays the outdoor temperature.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from microbit import *
    import radio

    # Choose own group in pairs 0-255
    radio.config(group=8)
    # Turn on the radio
    radio.on()

    outdoorTemp = '-'

    while True:
        message = radio.receive()
        if message:
            outdoorTemp = message
        if button_a.was_pressed():
            display.scroll(str(temperature()))
        elif button_b.was_pressed():
            display.scroll(outdoorTemp)

    #. Modify the code of the microbits so that they both scroll the outdoor temperature every 60 seconds.
    #. Modify the code of the outdoor microbit so that when the outdoor microbit is reset along with pressing the A-button, the time between sends is 10 seconds. When it is reset along with pressing the B-button, the time between sends is 30 seconds. On reset with button pressing the sleep time is 60 seconds.
