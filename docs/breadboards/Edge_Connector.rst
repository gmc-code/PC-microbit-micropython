| The microbit in the edge connector is facing up.
| The female to male jumper wires in the photo have been connected in the back row of pins marked 0, 1 and 2 and the ground connection marked 0V. 
| Each microbit pin has 2 pins on the edge connector for jumper wires to plug onto. The female end is placed over the pins that stick up.
| The 0V ground pin of the microbit has 4 pins on the edge connector to connect to.
| Devices that are connected via the breadboard will usually have jumpers from pin 0, 1 or 2, with the circuit completed via the ground 0V pin.
