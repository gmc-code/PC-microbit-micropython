----
Connections
--------------------------

| The LEDs must be placed in line with a 47 ohm resistor.
| The 47 ohm resistor has Yellow, Violet, Black, Gold coloured bands.
| LEDS are normally connected to pin0, pin1, or pin2.
| All LEDS are also connected to the 0V pins.

| Bend the resistor by holding it at the bend position so it is U-shaped.

    :scale: 50 %

| Place the resistor in the breadboard so that the legs go in about 5mm.

Model
----------------------------------------

#.  Place the resistors first.
#.  Place the LEDs with the **long lead** (leg) so that it is closest to the pin side of the circuit. In this model, the long lead is on the **left** side of the breadboard.
#.  Check that the red LED is connected to pin0, yellow to pin1, and green to pin2.
#.  Connect with the jumper wires.

Write digital
----------------------------------------

.. py:function:: pinx.write_digital(value)

    | ``pinx`` is the pin. e.g pin0, pin1, pin2.
    | ``value`` is 1 for on and 0 for off.


| To turn the LED on fully use ``pin0.write_digital(1)`` for the LED on pin0.
| To turn the LED off use ``pin0.write_digital(0)`` for the LED on pin0.
| For the other pins, just replace ``pin0`` with ``pin1`` or ``pin2``.

----

Turn on and off pin0
----------------------------------------

| Pressing A turns **on** the LED on pin0.
| Pressing B turns **off** the LED on pin0.

        elif button_b.is_pressed():
            pin0.write_digital(0)
        sleep(500)

Turn all on and off
----------------------------------------

| Pressing A turns **on** the LED on pin0, pin1 and pin2.
| Pressing B turns **off** the LED on pin0, pin1 and pin2.
